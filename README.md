# HTML / CSS - User Interface Project 

We will be building a single page website throughout this week.  We will approach the layout in a few different ways so that we can learn the many challenges of building user interface.  The first challenge will be to build the interface using only the box model and display types of block and inline.  You can use floats and clears if you want as well!

The second challenge will be to re-approach your first build with flexbox techniques.  Don't accomplish the second challenge until you have completely finished the page using box model and display types only!

*Hint*
The HTML is already in the project, you can use that as a guide for your CSS. If you want to stretch yourself, delete the HTML and start from scratch.
